## new comments:

I was making a new repository for this project when I got this issue:

---
Author identity unknown

*** Please tell me who you are.

Run

  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

to set your account's default identity.
Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.

fatal: unable to auto-detect email address (got 'vceli@DESKTOP-Q8EU766.(none)')
---

(my github is under my iupui email)
now, it seems like I can fix this with a command and adding my email but I don't want to mess anything up until I ask. So, for now I am updating this readme with a new link to the new project which should in turn show the updates.
