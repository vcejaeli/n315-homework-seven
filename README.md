## comments:
I was very confused with the steps. I thought I had something when I was following the 
https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2012900/pages/starting-a-firebase-project page but then it asked me to connect to github and a few other things and I wasn't sure what it would do so I cancelled. I clearly didn't do this correctly. 
If you can, the class lecture (oct 25th) upload would help a lot when you get a chance! I can at least go back and see what I could've done differently. 

Thanks!
